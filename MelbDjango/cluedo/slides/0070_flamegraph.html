      This section is about our investigation into our performance
      woes. Django Debug Toolbar, as good as it is, didn't cut the
      Mustard. We couldnâ€™t just take a wild stab in the dark, we
      needed to choose the right tool for the job. Here I'll talk
      about flamegraphs, a technique that helped us track down all
      three of our culprits.

      About 18 months ago I went to Dockercon in Austin Texas.  While
      I was there I was fortunate enough to see a talk by Brendan
      Gregg, an engineer from Uber.  He spoke about how Uber is able
      to analyse their containerised environments for performance
      issues. And one of the tools they use leverages a visual
      technique called a flamegraph. So what is a flamegraph?
    </p>
    <p>
      A flamegraph is a representation of collected profiling data.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's designed to make the interpretation of profiling data much
      easier, presenting an intuitive view of where time is spent in the
      code.
    </p>
    <p>
      Becuase it's just a representation of the profiling data it can work
      with many other standard profiling tools, such as Linux's "ptrace".

      This is an example of a Flamegraph generated for a query being
      run through MySQL. The x-axis on the graph is the increasing
      time of execution of the program, and the y-axis represents the
      call-stack.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notice that the graph is shown as a sequence of stacked
      bars. Each bar represents the time spent in a particular
      function. The further up the graph a bar appears, the deeper
      into the stack the call is.
    </p>
    <p>
      So in this example, the entry function is "handle_select". The
      bar immediately above this is called "mysql_select". Now because
      that bar covers the entire horizontal surface of
      "handle_select", that indicates that as soon as we enter the
      first function we call out to the next; not much time is
      actually spent running code in the first function.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is also true for the third call in the stack.
    </p>
    <p>
      But on the fourth row we can see that there are two function
      calls that consume significant time. Here we can see that about
      two thirds of the time spent is in sorting indices, and about
      one third spent on executing the select.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a Flamegraph, we tend to look for wide bars, as high up the
      call stack as possible. These are excellent places to begin
      looking deeper into the code to see what's happening.

  <h2>PyFlame</h2>
  <a href="https://github.com/uber/pyflame">https://github.com/uber/pyflame</a>
  <ul>
    <li>Python specific</li>
    <li>Generates flamegraph-ready data</li>
    <li>No instrumentation required</li>
    <li>Very low overhead</li>
  </ul>
  <aside class="notes">
    <p>
      At Dockercon, Brendan Gregg demonstrated the use of PyFlame, a
      Python based flamegraph utility. The greatest advantage of
      PyFlame, in my opinion, is that it requires no instrumentation
      of your source code and provides next to no overhead. This means
      it can be used in production if necessary to analyse real-world,
      live, problems.

  <p>So, I ran our task endpoint using PyFlame...</p>

      It produced a lot of data, and a large graph. Let's examine a
      smaller subset to get a feel for what's going on.

      While still a little dense, this graph covers the bulk of the
      database query phase, and a part of serialization.  There is a
      fairly distinct separation between the two, with the left side
      being the database query, and the right being in Django Rest
      Framework.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now it's a little unclear due to the size of this image, but
      on each of those bars there are filenames and line numbers, making
      it striaght-forward to identify where in the code we can begin
      to examine. This is the strength of flamegraphs; they make clear
      the specific locations in your source code, both file and
      line-number, that are candidates for performance examination but in
      an intuitive representation.
