    For quite a long time this approach served us pretty well. The queries came
    in, and were serviced typically around the 500ms mark. This isn't fantastic,
    but didn't warrant spending too much time being concerned about.

    But over time the task model and it's connections grew larger, and more complex. This effect became noticeable, and then eventually catastrophic. If a user
    selected enough additional column, the query could end up taking around 3 to 4 seconds to complete.

    So, what were we to do? What would be our first steps?

    Why, DDT, of course. The ubiquitous Django performance debugging tool. DDT
    is easily installed, and when running in debug mode provides a plethora of
    information useful for identifying where potential issues may be. Now, given
    the number of Django models we're hitting in our task queries, one would be
    forgiven for thinking the issue may lay in the database layer. But looking
    at the SQL tab in DDT we can see that only 120ms have been spent querying
    the database. And if we examine the CPU tab, well we can see where the time
    was spent. But what exactly is happening? The plot thickens...

    As is always the case, the real answer is a combination of different
    factors. On the left here we see a representation of the various
    contributing issues, and their relative contribution to our performance
    woes. Clearly the culprit at the top is the biggest problem, and here is
    where we bring in the Cluedo experience.

    A DRF query goes through, broadly speaking, a sequence of 4 phases: the
    viewset, model, serializer, and renderer. In the viewset, the query is
    dispatched to a handling function. Authentication and authorisation is
    enforced. A queryset for the database is prepared, and pagination applied.
    In the model phase the queryset is carried out and the results loaded. Then,
    in the serilizer phase, the models are processed and converted into the
    outgoing data. Finally, the renderer phase converts the data into the format
    expected by the client.

    So, we know that in one of these phases the issues are happening. TODO
