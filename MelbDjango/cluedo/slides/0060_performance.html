      Now, at the beginning, this use of DRF, and DRF-JSONAPI worked
      very well indeed. Our Task endpoint performed well enough,
      taking approximately 400ms for larger queries, but generally
      was much faster on average.
    </p>
    <p>
      However over time, as we added more connections to our Task
      model, and we added more fields, this began to slow down, and we
      said to ourselves, “we should look in to that one day”.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then we noticed it slow down even more, and again our
      sentiment was “one day, we'll get to that when we have time”. It
      wasn't until some of these task queries were taking up to four
      seconds that we decided that "that day was today".

      So of course our first port of call was the Django Debug
      Toolbar. The mainstay of the Django performance analyser's
      arsenal. When we began looking in to this we entirely expected
      the issue to be rooted in a database query explosion of some
      kind. But that was not the explanation at all. We were spending
      a mere 120ms in the database. And a whopping 3000 milliseconds
      spent in CPU. What in the world could be causing this? The plot
      was rapidly thickening.

      Of course answers are never so easy, and I can tell you that our
      performance was attacked on all sides, in various ways. All up
      there about seven key areas we found that needed to be fixed,
      each carrying a significant performance impact. This here is a
      representation of the top three performance costs we found. The
      top one coming in at a whopping 800 milliseconds. In a while I'm going to
      go through each of these top three suspects and explain what caused them.

  <h3>Let's play a game</h3>
  <aside class="notes">
    <p>
      But before that, I'd like to play a little game. In the spirit
      of Cluedo, I have an envelope in which there are three
      cards. Each card corresponds to a fact about the location of the
      top-most performance cost. In a moment I'm going to hand out
      some cards and pens, and your challenge will be to guess as
      close as possible to the contents of this envelope by writing
      down three things on the cards.

    </div>
  </div>
  <aside class="notes">
    <p>
      The first you must choose, will be the software package in which
      you think the greatest performance cost is located. This is in
      one of Django, Django Rest Framework, Django Rest Framework JSON
      API, or perhaps the issue lay in our code at Uptick.
    </p>

    </div>

  <aside class="notes">
    <p>
      The second thing to write is the request phase in which you
      think the cost may be happening in. So, very broadly speaking,
      there are four phases to each request that our API handles. The
      "parse" phase involves taking the incoming request and parsing
      it into useful information. The "model" phase is that of loading
      data from the database and placing it in Django models. The
      "serialize" phase takes those models and produces outgoing
      data. And the "render" phase creates the final JSON data to send
      to the client.

      Finally, you need to write specifically what you think it is
      that has caused the performance problem. Be as specific as you
      like here, and at the end of the talk we'll see who is the closest to the correct answer
      and we will be giving away a copy of Cluedo which CommonCode have so
      graciously provided, isn't that nice of them?

    <p>
      So, you need to write down one option from each of the first two
      rows, and then finally write down your specific guess on what
      the cause of the performance cost might be.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an example, on my card I might write down "Django", to indicate I think
      the problem is something in Django's code, and then "serialize",
      to indicate I think the problem is happening during
      serialization, and then I might write something like "URL
      reverse lookups", because I happen to think that performing URL reverses
      can be particularly slow. Interestingly that example is actually
      one of the other performance issues we found outside of the top three; it was taking
      about 100ms in total to perform URL reverse lookups on each returned Django
      model.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'll give you a little time to write down your guesses and
      return them to the front. Also, please don't forget to write
      your name on the card.
