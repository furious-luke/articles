      On it's way to taking a full second each time the endpoint was
      called, the final suspect has probably wasted days of CPU time
      for us. It must have surely been for something important, right?
      Something worthy? Well let's open the envelope and find out, shall we?
    </p>
    <p>
      Pluralisation... adding "s"s to words. Sometimes taking an "s"
      away. Why, in the world, would JSON-API be spending almost a
      full second doing this? Before we check for a winner, let's look a little
      closer at this issue.

      Looking briefly at the flamegraph we can see the calls going out
      to the Python inflection package at the top there. This package is used
      to alter strings to be in plural or singular form. Let's look at the source code.

  <pre style="font-size: 0.8rem"><code data-trim data-noescape>
def get_resource_type_from_included_serializer(self):
    """
    Check to see it this resource has a different resource_name when
    included and return that name, or None
    """
    field_name = self.field_name or self.parent.field_name
    parent = self.get_parent_serializer()
    if parent is not None:
        # accept both singular and plural versions of field_name
        field_names = [
            inflection.singularize(field_name),
            inflection.pluralize(field_name)
        ]
        includes = get_included_serializers(parent)
        for field in field_names:
            if field in includes.keys():
                return get_resource_type_from_serializer(includes[field])
    return None
  </code></pre>
  <aside class="notes">
    <p>
      It's in a function called
      "get_resource_type_from_included_serializer", and it appears to
      be trying to create a default name for included models on
      JSONAPI serializers. It takes the field name, and calls
      "inflection" to prepare a singular and plural form. This happens for every serializer, in every request,
      every time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, we were able to resolve this, in its entirity, by using a good old
      fashioned lookup table.

      I'm really not sure there's any more to say about this. I'd have
      thought it would be pretty obvious: don't bother pluralising
      strings in performance critical parts of your API library, and
      yet, here we are.

      So I hope you were all able to take away something useful from that talk, and that you
      found it perhaps a little entertaining. If you'd like to dig a little deeper into those
      performance issue, or their solutions, or especially Cluedo, then by all means come and
      have a chat with me later.
