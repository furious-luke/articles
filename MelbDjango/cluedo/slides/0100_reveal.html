      On it's way to taking a full second each time the endpoint was
      called, the final suspect has probably wasted days of CPU time
      for us. It must have surely been for something important, right?
      Well let's open the envelope and find out, shall we?
    </p>
    <p>
      Pluralisation... adding "s"s to words. Sometimes taking an "s"
      away. Why, in the world, would JSON-API be spending almost a
      full second doing this? Before we check for a winner, let's look a little
      closer at this issue.

      Looking briefly at the flamegraph, once we zoom in we can see the calls going out
      to the Python inflection package at the top there. This package is used
      to alter strings to be in plural or singular form. Let's look at the source code.

  <pre style="font-size: 0.8rem"><code data-trim data-noescape>
def get_resource_type_from_included_serializer(self):
    """
    Check to see it this resource has a different resource_name when
    included and return that name, or None
    """
    field_name = self.field_name or self.parent.field_name
    parent = self.get_parent_serializer()
    if parent is not None:
        # accept both singular and plural versions of field_name
        field_names = [
            inflection.singularize(field_name),
            inflection.pluralize(field_name)
        ]
        includes = get_included_serializers(parent)
        for field in field_names:
            if field in includes.keys():
                return get_resource_type_from_serializer(includes[field])
    return None
  </code></pre>
  <aside class="notes">
    <p>
      It's in a function called
      "get_resource_type_from_included_serializer", and it appears to
      be trying to create a default name for included models on
      JSONAPI serializers. It takes the field name, and calls
      "inflection" to prepare a singular and plural form. This happens for every serializer, in every request,
      every time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, we were able to resolve this, in its entirity, by using a good old
      fashioned lookup table. Once we'd calculated the inflections once, we cached them, and
      reused them as needed.

  <h2>"Professor S": Lesson</h2>
  <p>
    <em>Test your performance critical code</em>
  </p>
  <aside class="notes">
    <p>
      It's very easy to condemn code doing something like pluralising strings using
      an expensive operation, in the middle of performance critical code, but it's pretty
      clear that the author expected pluralisation to be quick, which is probably fair
      enough. However a brief test would have highlighted that this is not the case, so remember to do some performance testing. And if there is
      any other lesson, I think it's that lookup tables are your best friend.

      So I hope you were all able to take away something useful from that talk, and that you
      found it perhaps a little entertaining. If you'd like to dig deeper into those
      performance issues, or their solutions, or especially Cluedo, then by all means come and
      have a chat with me later.
