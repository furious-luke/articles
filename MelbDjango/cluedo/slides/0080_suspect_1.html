      Okay, in this, the final section, I'll be covering each of our
      suspects in order of least time consuming to the most, and
      we'll be looking at what went wrong, how we fixed it, and lessons learned.

      This particular suspect clocks in at approximately 200ms, so
      let's take a look at the flamegraph and see what we can see.

      Okay, this flamegraph was generated to highlight a certain
      region of the overall operation. This shows a segment where a
      Django Rest Framework serializer is being constructed and
      run. There's a bit of a wide bar happening near the top there,
      let's focus on that. It looks to be in a function named
      "get_fields" in DRF. So, let's take a look at that code and see
      what's going on.

class Serializer(BaseSerializer):

    @property
    def fields(self):
        """
        A dictionary of {field_name: field_instance}.
        """
        # `fields` is evaluated lazily. We do this to ensure that we don't
        # have issues importing modules that use ModelSerializers as fields,
        # even if Django's app-loading stage has not yet run.
        if not hasattr(self, '_fields'):
            self._fields = BindingDict(self)
            for key, value in self.get_fields().items():
                self._fields[key] = value
        return self._fields

    def get_fields(self):
        """
        Returns a dictionary of {field_name: field_instance}.
        """
        # Every new serializer is created with a clone of the field instances.
        # This allows users to dynamically modify the fields on a serializer
        # instance without affecting every other serializer instance.
        return copy.deepcopy(self._declared_fields)

  <aside class="notes">
    <p>
      This is a slightly altered snippet of code from the Serializer
      class in DRF. The first method shown, "fields", returns a
      dictionary of the fields on a serializer. It does this by
      calling the second method, "get_fields". Now "get_fields" simply
      returns the declared fields on the serializer, but in doing so
      it creates a deep copy.
    </p>
    <p>
      It turns out this deep copy is our culprit. Now we were able to
      remove this time cost by using a shallow copy instead, however
      this can cause problems depending on how the serializer is used
      afterwards. If modifications are made to the fields themselves
      it will affect other serializer instances. However, we knew that we
      weren't dynamically altering any of our serializer fields, so we could
      get away with a shallow copy.

  <h2>Lesson</h2>
  <p>
    <em>Don't be so flexible as to ruin performance.</em>
  </p>
  <aside class="notes">
    <p>
      There's nothing wrong with flexibility, but sometimes too much
      can have a major effect on performance. Now I'm not saying that DRF made a mistake
      including such flexibility, but they could maybe have allowed a configuration option for
      those who could use the short-circuit case.
