      While I was writing this talk I got to wondering how many people
      would have played Cluedo. So, I took a look at Google Trends. It
      would seem that Christmas is Cluedo's time to shine, since 2004
      at least. Given we're in November, this is statistically almost
      the perfect time for a Cluedo themed talk. But for those who
      perhaps aren't so familiar, let's start with a brief
      refresher.

  <h1>Cluedo</h1>
  <h3>The Classic Mystery Game</h3>
  <aside class="notes">
    <p>
      Invented by a British pianist, the game is set as a murder
      mystery which takes place at a fancy dinner party. The game was originally called Murder, but Hasbro
      Entertainment thought that a little provocative, and thus they
      chose Cluedo, a portmanteau of the words Clue and Ludo.

      The main instruments of the game are three decks of cards, the
      first of which is the suite of suspects. There are cards to
      represent all of these characters, including the notorious Colonel
      Mustard, who, of course, is the namesake of my persona this
      evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that each of these characters involves a color. This is to
      match the player tokens that are moved around the playing board.

      The second deck is that of the potential locations of the
      murder. Each room corresponds to a location on the playing board. Players are able
      to move their tokens from room to room during the game.

      The third deck is that of the murder weapons. I've always been a
      little curious about the inclusion of the candlestick in this
      list. But, it turns out there have in fact been reports, even
      modern reports, of homicides by candlestick, so there you go.

      At the beginning of the game each of these decks are
      independently shuffled. Without any player seeing the faces of
      the cards, one from each deck is chosen at random and concealed
      within an envelope.

      This envelope is placed at the center of the board. All
      remaining cards are now shuffled together, and dealt evenly to
      the players, forming the playersâ€™ hands. Play then commences in
      a turn by turn basis, where each player attempts to be the first
      to deduce the content of the central envelope. This is achieved
      by asking judicious questions of their fellow players.

      When ready, players may make a guess in the form of the famous
      phrase which goes something like: "Professor Plum, in the
      library, with the candlestick". If they are correct, they have
      won. But if they chose poorly, they forfeit any chance to guess
      again and are effectively eliminated from the game.

      Every game has a particular skill required of the players to
      win.  In Poker one has to be able to bluff. Backgammon is a
      combination of strategy and luck. And Monopoly... well, in
      Monopoly you have to be prepared to lose all of your friends and
      family if you want to win.

      But in the world of Cluedo, the victor is decided principally by the
      one who takes the best notes. This game is all about note
      taking. Players come up with vast and comprehensive
      sheets in order to gain an edge. I found this particular sheet
      on an individual's Cluedo fan site, and comes with the catch
      phrase: "Beat and enrage your family and friends through logical
      deduction and unashamed nerdiness". I think that sums Cluedo up well, and will do
      nicely as a conclusion to this section.
