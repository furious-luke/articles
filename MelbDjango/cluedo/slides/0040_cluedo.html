    notion of solving a murder. TODO. Given it was invented in Britain in the
    1950s I was curious about how popular Cluedo remains today. Google Trends
    shows that it enjoys a regular resurgence each Christmas, so we're almost
    time for another peak, a serendipitous time to be delivering this talk.

    Besides a board, the
    game comes with three decks of cards. The first deck consists of the
    suspects. There are six in total, each with their own distinctive color. ...
    And of course, Colonel Mustard; the namesake of my persona this evening.

    At the beginning of the game, each deck is shuffled, and one of each
    category of card is selected at random, and in secret, and concealed in an
    envelope. This is the murder, and it is the player's responsibility to
    deduce the contents of the envelope.

    By moving their player token from room to room, on their turn players may
    ask questions of their opponents, gradually forming theories about the trio
    of cards in the envelope.

    And this of course leads to the classic Cluedo catch phrase... At this stage
    a player has either guessed correctly and wins, or has chosen poorly, and is
    now out of the game.

    Every game leverages different skills. Some games need the ability to bluff
    one's opponents, in others luck is the greatest ally. In the game of Cluedo,
    the winner is determined by one's ability to take notes. Advanced note
    taking strategies have been devised by many players, a testament to how
    geeky Cluedo is, and why I love it so.
