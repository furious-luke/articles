    Thank you Bec. Hello everyone! *Puff on pipe*
  </p>
  <p>
    So, what is this talk all about? Well, it's about two things very
    dear to me: an over-obsession with software performance, and the
    classic 1940s murder mystery boardgame, Cluedo.
  </p>
  <p>
    Yes, a talk about the dieing art of performance analysis. At
    Uptick one of our API endpoints had one foot in the grave. With
    performance so bad, we were crying bloody murder.

    When it comes to performance analysis one can't just take a wild
    stab in the dark, no, we brought to bear a more sophisticated
    weapon of choice.

    I'll try and keep this talk short and sharp, so I'll stop killing
    time and just get on with it.
