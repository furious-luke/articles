    Hello everyone, thank you all for having me this evening, especially while
    I'm dressed as Cololnel Mustard. There is really something about holding a pipe
    while delivering a talk, you must try it.
  </p>
  <p>
    This talk is about two things very dear to me: excessively
    worrying about software performance, and the classic 1940s murder
    mystery boardgame, Cluedo. At Uptick we found that one of our
    products had developed a severe performance issue. After some
    digging around in the supporting Django libraries we use, I found some
    pretty interesting/alarming results. So I'll be talking a bit
    about our products, the libraries we use, and the tool leveraged
    to dig into the performance issue.
  </p>
  <p>
    The marriage of Cluedo with this talk, in addition to my clothing,
    comes in the form of a little game we'll all play about half way
    in. I'll be asking you to have a guess about what you think the
    cause of our performance issue was, and we'll be giving away a
    prize to the closest guess. That prize is this here copy of
    Cluedo, provided by CommonCode, so thanks to CommonCode, and in particular
    Bec for doing the legwork!
