    Hello everyone, and thanks to MelbDjango for having me again, it's
    a pleasure.
  </p>
  <p>
    The last time I spoke here I described my efforts to migrate one
    of our products at aBAS from a good old fashioned WSGI gunicorn
    based system, to a sleek, new, futuristic Django Channels
    implementation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since then I've iced that partially completed cake, and sent it
    out into the harsh realities of our production environment.
  </p>
  <p>
    So today I'm going to talk you through how I went about deploying
    our Django Channels enabled application to Heroku, and also about
    a new Django package to leverage Channels as a background task
    queue.
  </p>
