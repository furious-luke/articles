    Hello everyone, thank you all for having me this evening.
  </p>
  <p>
    This talk is about two things very dear to me: excessively
    worrying about software performance, and the classic 1940s murder
    mystery boardgame, Cluedo. At Uptick we found that one of our
    products had developed a severe performance issue for one of its
    endpoints. I ended up digging into the supporting Django libraries
    we use and found some pretty interesting/alarming results. So I'll
    be talking a bit about our products, the libraries we use, and the
    tool leveraged to dig into the performance issue.
  </p>
  <p>
    The marriage of Cluedo with this talk comes primarily in the form
    of a little game we'll all play about half way in. I'll be asking
    you to have a guess about what you think the cause of our
    performance issue was, and the closest guess will be taking away
    this copy of Cluedo provided by CommonCode. So thank you very much
    to CommonCode.
  </p>
