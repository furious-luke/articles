    Moving on to the software performance. I'll first need to explain a little
    about the product in which we experienced the issue, and the libraries we
    use.

  <aside class="notes">
    At Uptick we have a number of products, but Workforce is our oldest and
    largest. It's designed to be used by companies that work in the fire safety
    industry, and it keeps track of what tasks need to be carried out at a
    commerical property in order to be safe.

  <p>Picture of how a task connects to other things</p>
  <aside class="notes">
    In Workforce we have the concept of a task, which represents a visit to a
    property in order to carry out a set of scheduled maintenance. This is
    pretty central to the software, and ends up having a lot of
    interconnectedness with the rest of the system.

    Our clients often want to see a list of their tasks, filtered in various
    ways. They also like to be able to see only the fields they're interested
    in, switched on and off on a per-user basis. This makes sense, and is a
    reasonable request given the number and variety of connected datums. The
    interface you see here is how we provide that functionality.

    <h3>DRF-JSONAPI</h3>

  <aside class="notes">
    To support this dynamic querying from our backend, we begin by using Django
    Rest Framework, the mainstay of writing RESTful applications in Django.

    In addition to DRF, we use an extension that provides an implementation of
    the JSON-API specification. The JSON-API specification gives us, amongst
    other things, a standardized way to dynamically include model relationships
    along with our queries, and this is how our task endpoints are able to
    dynamically return complex relationships depending on the filters applied.

    Now I could go into some more detail surrounding DRF and DRF-JSONAPI, but
    it's not critical to know the inner workings for the purposes of this talk,
    just that these packages are used, and vaguely what they do.

    And so using DRF and DRF-JSONAPI we are able to dynamically fetch complex
    relationships from the DB on demand.
