      Next, some background on the scene of our performance
      crime. Like Cluedo, there are a number of locations to
      consider. For us, these don't come as rooms of a mansion, but as
      Python frameworks and libraries. In this section I'll talk about
      our main product at Uptick, some of the libraries we use, and
      how we came to have our performance problems.

      At Uptick we have a number of products, but Workforce is our
      oldest and largest. It's designed to be used by companies that
      work in the fire safety industry, and, amongst many other
      things, it keeps track of what operations need to be carried out
      at a commerical property in order for the property to be
      compliant with national fire safety standards.

      In Workforce there is the concept of a Task. A Task represents a
      particular set of work that needs to be done at a certain time,
      at a certain property. In many ways Tasks form the backbone of
      the product. And, as such, they have a tendency to create
      something of a web of connections across our data models. From contractors, to billing-cards,
      the connections are many.

      A key feature of Workforce is providing our clients with a dynamic
      listing of all their tasks. Intrinsically this is not so
      difficult. The trouble begins when our clients, and each of
      their employees, wants to see a different set of columns, and
      filter by different parameters within this Task view. We needed to build
      our APIs  flexible enough to handle this broad set of variations in columns and
      filters.

      Workforce is written, of course, using Django, but most of the
      heavy lifting in our API is carried out by these two packages. The
      first I'm sure will be very familiar to you, Django Rest
      Framework, the ubiquitous RESTful API library for Django. The
      second may not be so familiar. An extension to DRF, Django Rest
      Framework Json-API implements the Json-API specification, or at
      least something close enough to it. So what is the Json-API
      specification?

    <h3>JSON-API Specification</h3>
    <a style="font-size: 0.6em" href="https://jsonapi.org/">https://jsonapi.org</a>
  </div>
  <aside class="notes">
    <p>
      Json-API is a standard developed to help build flexible and
      powerful APIs. It's designed to provide enhanced relationship
      querying, field selection, and pagination, amongst other
      things. The relationship querying is rather important to our
      Task list, as it allows easy selection of connected models
      from our client-side code.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, a request is made looking something like this: notice the
      include query parameter. This indicates that we're interested in
      fetching details not just about a task, but also about the
      property. The response to this request will come with a set of tasks
      and all connected properties.

      This is the top of our task serializer in Workforce. In many ways it's a standard DRF serializer, but there
      is also an "included_serializers" attribute is used to specify which
      serializer should be used to handle model relationships. Each of the connections
      from the task model that we saw before has a corresponding serializer entry here.
