      So, this suspect comes in at approximately half a second.

      This time we're looking at a part of the flamegraph where
      DRF-JSONAPI is in the serializer phase.  It seems to be spending
      a lot of time in the functions relating to looking up included
      models and serializers. Let's focus in on one of the wider bars
      near the top; we can see there's a method in there called
      "get_included_serializers", but before we look there, let's look again
      at how we define our included serializers for the task model.

  <pre style="font-size: 0.8rem"><code data-trim data-noescape>
class TaskSerializer(ModelSerializer):
    included_serializers = {
        'assigned_to': 'abas.apps.accounts.api.v2.serializers.UserSerializer',
        'parent_task': 'abas.apps.tasks.api.v2.serializers.TaskSerializer',
        'assigned_office': 'abas.apps.accounts.api.serializers.UserSerializer',
        'billingcard': 'abas.apps.billing.api.v2.serializers.BillingCardSerializer',
        'branch': 'abas.apps.branches.api.v2.serializers.BranchNameSerializer',
        'category': 'abas.apps.tasks.api.v2.serializers.TaskCategorySerializer',
        'client': 'abas.apps.clients.api.v2.serializers.ClientSerializer',
        'costcentre': 'abas.apps.costcentres.api.v2.serializers.CostCentreSerializer',
        'property': 'abas.apps.properties.api.v2.serializers.PropertySerializer',
        'round': 'abas.apps.tasks.api.serializers.RoundSerializer',
        'tags': 'abas.apps.tasks.api.serializers.TaskTagSerializer',
        'supporting_technicians': 'abas.apps.accounts.api.serializers.UserSerializer',
        'technician': 'abas.apps.accounts.api.serializers.UserSerializer',
        'author': 'abas.apps.accounts.api.serializers.UserSerializer',
        'contractor': 'abas.apps.contractors.api.serializers.ContractorSerializer',
        'servicegroup': 'abas.apps.routines.api.v2.serializers.ServiceGroupSerializer',
        'updated_by': 'abas.apps.accounts.api.v2.serializers.UserSerializer',
    }

      Again this is the beginning of the Task serializer definition. One thing to take
      note of here is that they're all defined as strings. They could equally be defined
      as the classes themselves, imported from the relevant files, but it's simpler and more
      convenient to use strings.

  <pre style="font-size: 0.8rem"><code data-trim data-noescape>
from django.utils.module_loading import import_string as import_class_from_dotted_path

def get_included_serializers(serializer):
    included_serializers = copy.copy(getattr(serializer, 'included_serializers', dict()))

    for name, value in six.iteritems(included_serializers):
        if not isinstance(value, type):
            if value == 'self':
                included_serializers[name] = (
                    serializer if isinstance(serializer, type) else serializer.__class__
                )
            else:
                included_serializers[name] = import_class_from_dotted_path(value)

    return included_serializers
  </code></pre>
  <aside class="notes">
    <p>
      Now let's look at the DRF-JSONAPI function that looks up these
      serializers. This is run every time a serializer is
      constructed, which happens during every request made. Note the call near the bottom to
      "import_class_from_dotted_path"; that's going to be called on
      every one of the string paths we saw just before, and also all
      the include strings from each included serializer therein. You'd
      think
      that once a class has already been imported it would keep a
      lookup in a table for it, but seemingly that's not the case, as
      it's still consuming about half a second in total.
    </p>
    <p>
      So how can we fix this? Well, the easiest way was to add a table
      to the code to keep each serializer class after we've looked it
      up once. The next time we grab it straight from the table. And that was it, a simple change
      that saved us half a second.

    <em>Python's importing library is slow.</em>

  <aside class="notes">
    <p>
      It's suprising to me that Python's importing library does not
      already cache imported files by their location. One could be
      forgiven for assuming that might be the case. However placing
      imports in a fairly time critical location is still probably a little silly, so we
      should all remember to keep our imports in performance safe locations.
